# HERE TO CREATE!

![Design preview for the coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of JavaScript and ReactJS.**
**Use React Hooks is required.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

Please use [ReactJS], [Typescript] and [Material UI](https://mui.com/) on the front-end. You have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional, but nice to have)*
- Use React Hook

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. 

In this challenge, you will find mobile and desktop designs in light and dark mode color schemes for both pages.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

There are no assets for this challenge, as the country flags will be pulled from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) and you can use an icon font library for the icons.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Please feel free to do any optimization to make your project stronger!

We are here to create, so donâ€™t be afraid of doing something else with data available, in case you think itâ€™s a good idea.
